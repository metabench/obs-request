# obs-request
HTTP and HTTPS requests returned as observable (from fnl)

Could / may as well include puppeteer requests?
Could use that when a normal one fails to work.

How to include more advanced features without getting in the way?
A middleware chain could be one way.

Could have various config options - but would prefer to have it process using concise option parameters.

obs-dl could be a more comprehensive module for (advanced) downloading.
